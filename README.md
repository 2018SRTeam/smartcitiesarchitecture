## To Use This Template

1. Create a new repository with the name you want to use as part of the link
2. Create a new repo branch called nist-pages (to prevent any cross contamination, you may wish to create this as an orphan branch). You can delete the "main branch" and make this new branch the default branch.
3. In the "Repo Settings", setup a WebHook with Payload URL of https://pages.nist.gov/deploy
4. clone the repo onto your computer
5. copy all files from the NISTPagesTemplate project
6. commit all the new files to the project and push to your repo

That's it! Find your page at https://pages.nist.gov/yourreponame
