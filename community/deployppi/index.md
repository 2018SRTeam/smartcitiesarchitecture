#Consensus Deployed PPI

The purpose of the consensus deployed PPI subgroup is to identify and describe existing exemplary smart city technology deployments that cross multiple architectures and expose PPI.

These deployments need to be “discovered” and analyzed so that they can be compared to the growing list of PPI identified in the Consensus PPI group.

The results of this analysis will provide an illustrative guide to how PPI can facilitate composable smart city deployments and thus lower the barrier to such applications of technology at city scale.
