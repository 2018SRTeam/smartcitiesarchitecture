##Charter

The purpose of the Consensus PPI subgroup is to analyze existing exemplary smart city architecture and Internet of Things (IoT) descriptions including standards, architectures, frameworks, and deployments.

It will document the overlapping concerns addressed such as functionality, data, timing, trustworthiness, and other concerns identified in the [CPS Framework](http://www.nist.gov/el/nist-releases-draft-framework-cyber-physical-systems-developers.cfm).

Once organized this way, it is possible to determine the common “properties” specified in these overlapping concerns which may include general concepts such as third party authentication, end node identification, and others.

The resulting analysis will permit the subgroup to document these “PPI” and show the gaps and overlaps of choices made by the creators of the reviewed specifications.
