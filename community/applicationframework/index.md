##Charter

The purpose of Application Framework is to explore a summary scope of smart city applications. Much of the content of this activity can be determined from various applications, structures, and, deployment initiatives happening around the globe. The result may be a simple diagram with a list of references. This will provide stakeholders an available cornucopia of applications that satisfy needs in their cities and municipalities.

Also in support of this effort, the collection/documentation of models of smart city applications metrics will help stakeholders evaluate their purchases and offerings.

Critically this subgroup provides user community feedback & interactions for the other two subgroups.
