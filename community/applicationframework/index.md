## Charter

### Scope
  * Assimilate Smart City Application Frameworks (deployed and proposed) 
  * Capture the Breadth of Applications in Cities (exhaustive list, dynamic in nature)
  * Provide a Framework to Measure Benefits that can be derived from these Applications (meeting the demand, better service delivery, need-based solutions, to drive behaviors in cities to accelerate innovation, enablers)
  * Identify Metrics to Assess the Readiness of Cities to Absorb these Applications (accessibility, interoperability, decision maker can evaluate performance)


### Guiding Principles
  * Framework/Metrics: Commonly Understandable and Flexible (adaptable)
  * Pilot Newly Developed Framework and Metrics in 5-6 Cities (diversity)


## Deliverables

  * A Framework to Measure Benefits that can be derived from Assimilated Applications (meeting the demand, better service delivery, need-based solutions, to drive behaviors in cities to accelerate innovation, enablers)
  * A List of Metrics to Assess the Readiness of Cities to Absorb Smart City Applications (accessibility, interoperability, decision maker can evaluate performance)
  * Outcomes of 5-6 City Pilots on Benefits Framework and Readiness Metrics

## Major Milestones -- Plan for Fall 2016

1.       Discuss first draft of frameworks/metrics for each subgroup: September 22 [Each group leader presents the first draft of the metrics for her/his subgroup, asks for collaboration/feedback on it, share the document with the partners]
2.         Identify a list of potential cities for pilot testing frameworks/metrics: September 22 (internal WG1 concall)
3.       Feedback about the presented documents have to be sent within September 29 (by email)
4.          Frameworks/metrics ready for all subgroups: October 6/ (external WG1 concall)
5.         Share almost final draft of each subgroup sections on Oct 15 and discuss it during an Internal Concall 
6.          October 16 for final status check and last edits
7.          First Draft finalized: October 21 - to be ready for the face-to-face meeting in Washington DC on Oct 27
8.         Pilot test Frameworks/Metrics with cities: Nov/Dec (guided interviews online or in person)
