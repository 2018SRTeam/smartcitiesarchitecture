## Charter

### Scope
  * Assimilate Smart City Application Frameworks (deployed and proposed) 
  * Capture the Breadth of Applications in Cities (exhaustive list, dynamic in nature)
  * Provide a Framework to Measure Benefits that can be derived from these Applications (meeting the demand, better service delivery, need-based solutions, to drive behaviors in cities to accelerate innovation, enablers)
  * Identify Metrics to Assess the Readiness of Cities to Absorb these Applications (accessibility, interoperability, decision maker can evaluate performance)


### Guiding Principles
  * Framework/Metrics: Commonly Understandable and Flexible (adaptable)
  * Pilot Newly Developed Framework and Metrics in 5-6 Cities (diversity)


## Deliverables

  * A Framework to Measure Benefits that can be derived from Assimilated Applications (meeting the demand, better service delivery, need-based solutions, to drive behaviors in cities to accelerate innovation, enablers)
  * A List of Metrics to Assess the Readiness of Cities to Absorb Smart City Applications (accessibility, interoperability, decision maker can evaluate performance)
  * Outcomes of 5-6 City Pilots on Benefits Framework and Readiness Metrics
