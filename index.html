		<h2 class="section-title">What is this Collaboration about?</h2>
		<p>Two barriers currently exist to effective and powerful Smart City solutions. First, many current smart city deployments are custom systems that are not extensible or cost-effective. Second, a number of architectural design efforts are currently underway but have not yet converged, creating uncertainty among stakeholders. To remove these barriers, NIST and its partners are convening an international public working group to distill from these architectural efforts and city stakeholders a consensus framework of common architectural features to enable Smart City solutions that meet the needs of modern communities.</p>
