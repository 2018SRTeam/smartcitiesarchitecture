			We had a small but very successful workshop in Austin on June 15-16. To recap, we started this endeavor in March and April with twin kickoff workshops at NIST and ENEA. At those workshops we established leadership and goals for three working groups -- Application Framework, Consensus PPI, and Deployed PPI. <br/><br/>Since those events, the working groups have been meeting and working on their concepts and implementing their charters. Our goal for the "midpoint" workshop was to have the work begun and far enough along that the plans of each working group could be shared with the others and that the "shape" of the results could be considered and we could develop a shared vision of the white paper to be completed by this fall. <br/><br/>

			These goals were quantitatively met. Of course there is a lot of heavy lifting to be done this summer, but the results do seem achievable. We summarize here the key highlights from the workshop:<br/><br/>
			<ul>
			<li>Application Framework working group further refined their plans and identified some writing targets to help form their deliverable.</li><br/>

			<li>Consensus Framework worked with oneM2M to refine their detailed analysis vs. the CPS Framework Aspects and Concerns.</li><br/>

			<li>Deployed PPI refined their plan to interact with a selected set of cities that represent MegaClusters (or SuperClusters) that they will use to obtain initial information and then more detailed information to help them populate their case studies.</li><br/>
			</ul>
			Collectively, participants drafted the an outline as a first pass at the form of the white paper we want to draft together. Of course, this outline is only a draft straw man at this time and intended to unify the work of the three working groups. See <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/nist-sgcps/smartcityframework/files/ies-city_framework/IES-CityFrameworkReportOutline_20160616.docx">here</a>. <br/><br/>
