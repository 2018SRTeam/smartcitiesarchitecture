The IES-City Framework (IoT-Enabled Smart City Framework) project is off and running. Working group meetings have begun. We are planning for a mid-project workshop in Austin on June 15,16. Itâ€™s not official yet, but save the date. At this workshop, we will review the progress of the three working groups who all expect to have work in progress to discuss. Of importance is that the three working groups will collaborate to plan the final deliverable. By combining their work to date, we will see the shape of the final output. Please join us for this pivotal meeting to discover Pivotal Points of Interoperability. For details on the work of the working groups, see [working groups]({{ site.baseurl }}/community/).
