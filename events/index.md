### (COMPLETED) June 13...16 GCTC Expo and IES-Cities Framework Midpoint Meeting

IES-City Framework Workshop: June 15th,16th 2016 in conjunction with the [GCTC Expo](http://www.gctcexpo.org/index.html) 

We had a small but very successful workshop in Austin on June 15-16. This workshop was at the tail end of the GCTC Expo which was itself a huge success with over 2000 attendees and nearly 100 action cluster presentations made. GCTC provides the raw drive and scope of the smart city applications that inform our IES-City Framework effort. Our technical effort, of course on a much smaller scale, endeavors to help drive the smart city and IoT world toward harmonization and interoperability through mostly technical analysis.

### (COMPLETED) March 24-25, 2016 NIST Campus, Gaithersburg MD
The kick-off workshop for the initiative will take place at NISTâ€™s Gaithersburg, Maryland campus, on March 24-25, 2016, in conjunction with the NIST [Global City Teams Challenge (GCTC) Tech Jam](http://www.nist.gov/cps/gctc-tech-jam-and-iot-enabled-smart-city-framework-workshop.cfm). The initiative expects to draw on the expertise of GCTC project teams that collaborate on city scale applications, and on the Draft Framework for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), produced by the NIST CPS public working group, which provides a science and engineering foundation for the Internet of Things (IoT).

### (COMPLETED) April 14-15, 2016 ENEA, Rome Italy
A second workshop will be held April 14-15, 2016 in Rome, Italy, hosted by ENEA. Both workshops will have similar formats with in-depth presentations from experts engaged in activities in the different geographic regions. Interim results will be considered at subsequent workshops in summer 2016. The hope is to produce an initial draft document by September and to finalize it by June of next year.
