# IES-City Framework Summer 2017 Working Sessions
 
<a href="#Bologna">Logistics for the Bologna Meeting</a> 

<a href="#Washington">Logistics for the Washington Meeting</a>

## Meetings Overview

We are working to have the results of the past year’s activity in our deliverables at the end of this summer. It will consist of the following:

1. A document describing the IES-City Framework - [Framework Draft In Progress](https://s3.amazonaws.com/nist-sgcps/smartcityframework/ies-city_framework/IES-CityFrameworkdraft.docx).
1. An easy to use spreadsheet tool that can be used to analyze and plan for Smart City deployments - [Application Framework Analysis Tool](https://s3.amazonaws.com/nist-sgcps/smartcityframework/ies-city_framework/TechnicalArtifacts/ApplicationFramework_BreadthAssessmentTool.xlsm).
1. A comparison of the concerns addressed and the technical components used in some major Smart City technology suites - [ConsensuPPI Analyses](https://s3.amazonaws.com/nist-sgcps/smartcityframework/ies-city_framework/TechnicalArtifacts/ConsensuPPIAnalysis_Comparison.xlsm).
1. A set of case summaries of smart city deployments around the world - [Analysis of DeployedPPI Raw Data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/nist-sgcps/smartcityframework/ies-city_framework/TechnicalArtifacts/DeployedPPI_InputData.xlsx).
 
When you review smart city standards and documents, you will find extensive sets of diagrams, architectures, and discussion. IES-City will provide a more austere presentation of tools that summarize and snapshot the smart city landscape in a digestible and actionable way.
 
For example, the Application Framework working group has digested the breadth of smart city applications along three dimensions – requirements, readiness, and benefits. As shown in the figure below, each of these dimensions is traced to a set of application categories and subcategories. The group has made the most substantial progress on the requirements and benefits dimensions. The readiness dimension remains to be developed.

The Consensus PPI working group is producing a set of analyses based on the NIST CPS Framework’s Aspects and Concerns. By this means we expect to digest the large sets of documentation of Smart City and IoT applications to a simple spreadsheet form:

Additionally, the concept of Zones of Concern has the ability to focus interoperability goals for Pivotal Points of Interoperability around two key interfaces (a concept actually dramatically presented by others at the ETSI OneM2M workshop last November):

And, at the recent conference in Geneva, it became apparent that several architectures can expose the same three key points (although this would be an oversimplification of the work of these groups, it is illustrative of their common traits):

Finally, the DeployedPPI working group is analyzing several (less than 9) significant Smart City applications for comparison.

# The Bologna Meeting June 29,30

The focus of the Bologna meeting, besides a presentation of status, will be a working session to create the “readiness” component of the Application Framework contribution to IES-City (sub-group 2). The application framework working group has done a great deal of work on the breadth of applications of smart cities, and, the benefits to citizens of these applications. The third and last dimension of this component is the “readiness” required of a city or municipality to incorporate an application. For example, if the application relies on widely available public WiFi as a pre-requisite to a way-finding application, it is important to recognize this requirement as its existence might make or break the economics or timescale of deployment.
 
We have found in ISO/IEC 30146 (Smart City ICT indicators) a set of potential indicators a subset of which can be identified as “readiness” indicators. Here is a link to the contribution provided Contribution #107 from that work. At the Bologna workshop we will seek to refine a subset of indicators from that work to be used as a checklist of readiness indicators. We then plan to use this list to annotate the subgroup 1 breadth of applications list.
 
At the workshop we will refine these concepts to a substantive set of readiness indicators and begin applying them to the applications of Smart Cities.
